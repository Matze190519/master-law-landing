    question: "How does the 0% Corporate Tax in Dubai work?",
    answer: "Since 2024, UAE Freezone companies can benefit from 0% Corporate Tax on 'Qualifying Income'. This generally applies to income derived from transactions with other Freezone entities or non-domestic activities. Income up to AED 375,000 (~€95,000) is also taxed at 0% for small businesses. We handle the full setup and compliance to ensure you meet all substance requirements."

    question: "What is the 'Ley de Segunda Oportunidad' in Spain?",
    answer: "It is a legal mechanism allowing individuals and self-employed persons to cancel their debts (BEPI) if they are insolvent and act in good faith. Unlike Germany's 3-year process, the Spanish procedure can often be completed in 12-18 months, offering a faster fresh start without a public Schufa-style record."

    question: "Can I really save taxes with the Beckham Law?",
    answer: "Yes. The Special Expats Regime (Beckham Law) allows you to pay a flat 24% tax rate on Spanish income up to €600,000, instead of the progressive rate which goes up to 47%. Crucially, your foreign income (e.g., dividends, interest outside Spain) remains tax-exempt in Spain. This is a massive advantage for high-net-worth individuals."

    question: "Do I need to live in Dubai to have a company there?",
    answer: "No, you do not need to live there permanently. However, to maintain tax residency and substance, it is recommended to visit at least once every 6 months and have a physical office presence (which we provide). This grants you a UAE Residency Visa."

    question: "How long does the Golden Visa process take?",
    answer: "The Spanish Golden Visa is one of the fastest in Europe. Once the investment (e.g., €500k in real estate) is made, the residence permit is typically approved within 20 working days. It grants you and your family full living and working rights in Spain."
