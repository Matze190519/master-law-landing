  **Design Movement**: "Titanium Glass Minimalism"
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **Materiality**: The interface should feel like it's made of physical, high-end materials: frosted glass, brushed titanium, and deep obsidian.
  2.  **Depth**: Extreme use of depth (z-index), blurs, and shadows to create a sense of space and exclusivity.
  3.  **Restraint**: Less is more. Only the most essential information is shown initially; details reveal themselves on interaction.
  4.  **Precision**: Every pixel, every border, every animation must be mathematically perfect, like a Swiss watch.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  -   **Obsidian Black (#050505)**: The base. Deep, infinite, absorbing light.
  -   **Titanium Grey (#2A2A2A)**: For structural elements. Cool, strong, industrial but refined.
  -   **Platinum White (#E5E5E5)**: For text. Not harsh pure white, but a soft, glowing platinum.
  -   **Accent**: No "colors". The accent is light itself (white glow, reflections).

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  -   **Bento Grids**: Content organized in highly structured, glass-like containers (like Apple's control center but darker and more premium).
  -   **Center-Stage**: The main value proposition is always center stage, with everything else fading into the background.
  -   **Fluid Typography**: Text size scales perfectly with the viewport, feeling "printed" on the screen.

  **Signature Elements**:
  -   **Frosted Glass Cards**: High backdrop-blur, thin white borders (1px), subtle noise texture.
  -   **Titanium Borders**: Gradients on borders that simulate metallic reflection.
  -   **Spotlight Effects**: Mouse movement reveals content through a "flashlight" effect on the glass.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  -   **Weighty Animations**: Elements don't just "appear"; they slide in with mass and momentum.
  -   **Magnetic Buttons**: Buttons that pull the cursor slightly, feeling tactile.

  **Animation**:
  -   **Slow Parallax**: Background elements move very slowly, creating a subconscious sense of depth.
  -   **Blur-In**: Content blurs into focus rather than fading in.

  **Typography System**:
  -   **Headlines**: "SF Pro Display" or "Inter" (tight tracking, heavy weight) - The Apple standard.
  -   **Body**: "SF Pro Text" or "Inter" (normal tracking, light weight).

  **Design Movement**: "Dark Luxury Monolith"
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **Dominance**: The design should feel imposing and powerful, like a skyscraper.
  2.  **Contrast**: Extreme contrast between pitch black and blinding light.
  3.  **Exclusivity**: The site should feel like a private club; not everyone is invited.
  4.  **Serenity**: No clutter, no noise. Just peace and control.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  -   **Void Black (#000000)**: Absolute black.
  -   **Champagne Gold (#F7E7CE)**: A very pale, desaturated gold used *only* for the finest lines and text highlights.
  -   **Marble White (#F0F0F0)**: For primary text.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  -   **Single Column**: A strict, single column of content that demands attention.
  -   **Full-Screen Sections**: Each section takes up the full screen, forcing focus.

  **Signature Elements**:
  -   **Marble Textures**: Subtle, dark marble textures in the background.
  -   **Gold Leaf Lines**: Extremely thin (0.5px) gold lines separating sections.
  -   **Serif Typography**: Using a modern high-contrast serif font for headlines to convey tradition and wealth.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  -   **Scroll Snap**: The user is guided through the narrative one screen at a time.
  -   **Elegant Hovers**: Text changes color slowly, like metal heating up.

  **Animation**:
  -   **Fade Up**: Everything rises from the darkness.
  -   **Line Drawing**: Borders draw themselves as you scroll.

  **Typography System**:
  -   **Headlines**: "Cinzel" or "Playfair Display" (Modern Serif).
  -   **Body**: "Montserrat" (Geometric Sans).

  **Design Movement**: "Invisible Tech"
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **Invisibility**: The interface should disappear, leaving only the content.
  2.  **Intelligence**: The site anticipates user needs (e.g., sticky booking button appears only when needed).
  3.  **Fluidity**: Everything is liquid; no hard edges, everything flows.
  4.  **Global**: Design that transcends culture, purely functional and beautiful.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  -   **Deep Navy (#02040A)**: A very dark blue, almost black, representing the night sky.
  -   **Neon Blue (#00F0FF)**: Used extremely sparingly for "active" states.
  -   **Silver (#C0C0C0)**: For secondary elements.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  -   **Free Flow**: Elements are placed organically, not in a rigid grid.
  -   **Floating UI**: Navigation and tools float above the content.

  **Signature Elements**:
  -   **Glowing Orbs**: Abstract, blurred orbs of light in the background.
  -   **Glass Morphism**: Heavy use of glass for all UI elements.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  -   **Liquid Motion**: Elements morph into each other.
  -   **Gaze Tracking**: (Simulated) elements react to where the user is likely looking.

  **Animation**:
  -   **Morphing**: Shapes change form fluidly.
  -   **Ripple Effects**: Clicks create ripples.

  **Typography System**:
  -   **Headlines**: "Uncut Sans" or "Satoshi".
  -   **Body**: "General Sans".
