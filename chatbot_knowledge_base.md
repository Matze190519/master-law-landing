## 8. FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

**Q: Can I live in Germany and have a Dubai company?**
A: Yes, but be careful. If you manage the company from Germany, German tax authorities may treat it as a German tax resident entity ("Place of Management" rule). You need "substance" in Dubai (local director, office, decisions made in Dubai) to avoid this.

**Q: Is the Golden Visa retroactive?**
A: Yes, if you bought a property for €500k+ after September 2013, you can apply.

**Q: How long does it take to open a bank account in Dubai?**
A: It can take 2-4 weeks depending on the bank and your nationality. We assist with this process.

**Q: Do I have to pay tax in Dubai?**
A: Only if your net profit exceeds AED 375,000 (~€95,000) AND it is not "Qualifying Income". Otherwise, it is 9%. There is no personal income tax on salaries.

**Q: What is the "Beckham Law"?**
A: It's a nickname for the Special Expats' Regime in Spain, allowing new residents to pay a flat 24% tax instead of the progressive scale (up to 47%).
